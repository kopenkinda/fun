// We suppose that the nodes of a multiway tree contain single
//    characters. In the depth-first order sequence of its nodes, a
//    special character ^ has been inserted whenever, during the
//    tree traversal, the move is a backtrack to the previous level.
//    By this rule, the tree in the figure opposite is 
//    represented as: afg^^c^bd^e^^^
// 
//    Define the syntax of the string and write a predicate tree(String,Tree)
//    to construct the Tree when the String is given. Work with atoms (instead
//    of strings). Make your predicate work in both directions.
