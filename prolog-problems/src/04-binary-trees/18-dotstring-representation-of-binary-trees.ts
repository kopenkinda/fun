// We consider again binary trees with nodes that are identified by
//        single lower-case letters, as in the example of problem 4.16. Such a
//        tree can be represented by the preorder sequence of its nodes in which
//        dots (.) are inserted where an empty subtree (nil) is encountered
//        during the tree traversal. For example, the tree shown in problem 4.16
//        is represented as 'abd..e..c.fg...'. First, try to establish a 
//        syntax (BNF or syntax diagrams) and then write a predicate
//        tree_dotstring/2 which does the conversion in both directions. 
//        Use difference lists.
//
